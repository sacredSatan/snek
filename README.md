# snek
A game of Snake made with React

## But why?

Why not? I just started learning React and thought this would be a nice idea to do something like this.

Full disclosure, I had written a Snake clone with a shitty rival AI snake about a year ago in C, so the logic is kind of the same, I didn't change anything. I'm sure this isn't the efficient way of handling any of this, I'll improve this project periodically. Main goal is to learn to use ReactJS.

### TODO List

- ~Improve the UX by adding restart button~
- Allow users to resize the gameplay area
- Add instructions on how to play
- Optimize the code, follow the recommended conventions (of course)
- Use HTML5 Canvas for the drawing of the game
- Add a Rival AI Snake
